<h3 id="part-c">Part C:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Example: The elevator in the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering building at Texas Tech</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control interface</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Issues with the current design
    <ul>
      <li>Floor buttons aligned horizontally</li>
      <li>Don't know when the door will be closing</li>
      <li>No estimated time of arrival to the desire floor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explain why it is bad
    <ul>
      <li>Floor buttons align horizontally => instead of horizontal direction, it should be vertical</li>
      <li>No estimated time of arrival to the desire floor (optional). => if there is a feature displaying estimated time of arrival, there should be an electronic board</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="part-b">Part B:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
    <ul>
      <li>Elevator in TTU, for example in Computer Science building, Raider Park and other places, the increment of floor is always horizontal. </li>
      <li>Emergency buttons (Call operator, fire alarm): used in very rare case, and need to be marked better</li>
      <li>The interface makes doing the common things easier when it’s properly designed (most of the cases), and can 
  help to save time and effort of users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
    <ul>
      <li>There should be some feedbacks showing how many times a button (floor) has been pressed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
    <ul>
      <li>There is no feedback to user when elevator arrives at a floor. Sometimes door opens and people just randomly walk out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
    <ul>
      <li>I suggest to improve the feedback to users such as: notify users whether the door is closing or opening; notify users whether a desired floor is reached; time estimation for each floor</li>

    </ul>


</ul>

<h3 id="part-a">Part A</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator</p>
  </li>
  <li>Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
    <ul>
      <li>The design for the touch screen: Please see the <a href="https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html">demo</a>, 
  https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html.</li>
      <li>Screen size: 24in x 18in for the control panel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design and implement interactive features
    <ul>
      <li>On touch screen, the button is highlighted when chosen. The background is dynamic so user knows it’s a touch 
  screen.</li>
      <li>There are indicator for the position of the users inside the building.</li>
      <li>The emergency light goes off when there is an emergency outside. This button is put on a high position so users
   in the back can see it. User can use the alarm button to call outside.
  for help</li>
      <li>Please see the <a href="https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html">demo</a>, 
    https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design and implement user feedback
    <ul>
      <li>The indicator point goes up/down for every time the current floor changes.</li>
      <li>The indicator light shows the direction and the corresponding floor.</li>
      <li>Please see the <a href="https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html">demo</a>, 
    https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Design and implement in my sketch
    <ul>
      <li>Buttons assigned the floors are placed vertically</li>
      <li>Feed back to elevator users by changing the color. Green for the floors,</li>
      <li>The users can cancel their wrong options by double-clicking at the floor 3, floor 2, floor 1 and basement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
