<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Example: The elevator in the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering building at Texas Tech</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control interface</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fAbByUYxLUGE6ygSvZ/giphy.gif" alt="Elevator_Gif_Huyen" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Issues with the current design
    <ul>
      <li>In image 2, there are no indicators to show the current floor, even though the destination floor has been chosen.</li>
      <li>The light for the Open button sometimes does not work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explain why it is bad
    <ul>
      <li>Hence there are no indicators to show the current floor, users may find it difficult to identify their current 
  position, until the elevator door is open.</li>
      <li>The light of the buttons is important, because it illustrate if the button is chosen or not.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="part-b">Part B:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
    <ul>
      <li>Common things for using an elevator: Go up/down the floors instead of taking the stairs, to carry stuff from one 
  floor to another. Sometimes the staircase is outside, so using elevator can be convenient despite the weather 
  that day.</li>
      <li>Some rare uses: Using the mirror inside the elevator when it’s an emergency for preparation.</li>
      <li>The interface makes doing the common things easier when it’s properly designed (most of the cases), and can 
  help to save time and effort of users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
    <ul>
      <li>Common sequence of action: Click up/down button outside the elevator -&gt; Going inside -&gt; Choose close/open door 
  -&gt; Choose the desired destionation floor(s)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
    <ul>
      <li>On the control panel, there are numbers indicating the floors, these buttons/numbers are normally ordered from big
   to small from top down. Also, light on the button is on when that button is chosen. Besides numbers, there are 
   often image or symbol showing the corresponding use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
    <ul>
      <li>Light is on when a button is chosen.</li>
      <li>Door opens/closes when the buttons of open/close are chosen</li>
      <li>The indicator inside the elevator shows the current floor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
    <ul>
      <li>When the buttons are too close to each other, I can mistake pushing other one instead of the desired one.</li>
      <li>The indicator light sometimes shows the wrong number and direction, so sometimes I go the opposite direction as
   I wanted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.
    <ul>
      <li>The interface has the usual use of elevator: Go up/down, open/close door.</li>
      <li>Supports disability people with support button, Braille buttons.</li>
      <li>Has speaker and button near the ground for the users who fall down to the ground.</li>

<h3 id="part-a">Part A</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator</p>
  </li>
  <li>Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
    <ul>
      <li>The design for the touch screen: Please see the <a href="https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html">demo</a>, 
  https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html.</li>
      <li>Screen size: 24in x 18in for the control panel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design and implement interactive features
    <ul>
      <li>On touch screen, the button is highlighted when chosen. The background is dynamic so user knows it’s a touch 
  screen.</li>
      <li>There are indicator for the position of the users inside the building.</li>
      <li>The emergency light goes off when there is an emergency outside. This button is put on a high position so users
   in the back can see it. User can use the alarm button to call outside.
  for help</li>
      <li>Please see the <a href="https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html">demo</a>, 
    https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design and implement user feedback
    <ul>
      <li>The indicator point goes up/down for every time the current floor changes.</li>
      <li>The indicator light shows the direction and the corresponding floor.</li>
      <li>Please see the <a href="https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html">demo</a>, 
    https://nnhuyen.github.io/elevator/demo.html.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extra-credits">Extra credits:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Your design supports people with disabilities
    <ul>
      <li>For user who accidentally fall down to the ground, there is a button and speaker near the ground so they can 
  call outside for help. Also, there is a support button for people in wheelchair.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You provide extra useful information on the display interface.
    <ul>
      <li>Inside the elevator, users can see a screen showing:
        <ul>
          <li>The current date, time,</li>
          <li>Inside and outside temperature.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
